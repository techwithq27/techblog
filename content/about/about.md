## Welcome to my Tech Blog

Hello! This blog is for me to post about tech, IT, webhosting, and coding related topics. Some are about what I find interesting, some are my thoughts, and some are about the fixes I find or create for the stuff I run into, either professionaly or on the hobby projects I work on. At some point I'll allow comments and posts, but after some years in the industry, its past time for me to have a site of some kind, so here we are. If there's something that helps someone, then great! Otherwise, lets fight about text editors. I use vim, by the way. =P
